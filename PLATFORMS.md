# Platform support

What runs where, and how it was verified. Every claim below was
exercised against real binaries — install, boot, policy verdicts,
budget blocks, receipt seal/verify, tamper rejection — not inferred
from "it compiles". (Verification rounds 93–99, September 2026.) The
Windows section is the exception: it says which features were run on a
Windows runner and which were only compiled and unit-tested.

## Tier 1 — prebuilt binaries (installer default)

`curl -fsS https://proofvisor.com/install.sh | sh` downloads these,
verifies the SHA-256, installs, and smoke-runs them on your machine.

| Target | Notes |
|---|---|
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` | **Static** — runs on every x86_64 Linux regardless of glibc age or libc flavor. Verified on Ubuntu 24.04/22.04, Debian 12/11, Rocky 8 (glibc 2.28), Amazon Linux 2023, Fedora 42, Arch, openSUSE Leap 15.6, Alpine 3.20. |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` | Static; verified on Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Alpine 3.20, Fedora 42 (arm64). |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | Verified on macOS 14+ (Apple silicon). |
| `x86_64-apple-darwin` | Verified on macOS 15 (Intel). |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | Also published; needs glibc ≥ 2.38. The installer always uses the musl build on Linux. |

## Tier 2 — build from source (verified working)

The installer falls back to `cargo install` from the public repo on
any other Unix (or force it with `PV_INSTALL_SOURCE=1`). These
targets were built and run through the full gate battery under
emulation:

| Target | Notes |
|---|---|
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | Built from source; not exercised in CI (the nightly arm64 runner installs the musl build). |
| `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` | 32-bit ARM (Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit). The policy sandbox uses wasmtime's portable interpreter where no native JIT exists. Expect a long compile on a Pi. |
| `riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu` | Native cranelift JIT backend. |
| `powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu` | Works from v0.1.0-rc.4; earlier builds hit a per-arch `O_NOFOLLOW` constant bug that fail-closed every session (fixed, regression-tested on ppc64le). |
| `s390x-unknown-linux-gnu` | Big-endian. Receipts sealed on s390x verify on little-endian hosts and vice versa — the receipt framing and signatures are endian-clean. |

## Receipts are portable

A receipt sealed on any platform above verifies with `pvctl
receipt-verify` on any other — across architecture, bitness (32→64),
and endianness (BE⇄LE) — because verification hashes a canonical
byte frame (`agentvisor-receipt-v2\0` + big-endian length + body).

## Windows

Native Windows x64 (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) is a Tier 2 platform for
the daemon and the CLI, with the differences listed below. Each release
includes a prebuilt `.zip`; `install.sh` does not install it. CI
compiles, unit-tests and boot-tests the binaries on a hosted runner;
they have never run on customer hardware. Everything else
in this repository (installer, systemd unit, container images, the
hosted console) is Unix-only and needs WSL on a Windows machine.

How it is verified (2026-10-31): the whole workspace, including every
test target, compiles for the Windows target from the development
machine (`cargo check --workspace --all-targets --target
x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` with the MinGW-w64 toolchain, zero errors), and
the `windows` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds `proofvisord`
and `pvctl` with MSVC on `windows-latest` and runs the workspace unit
tests (`cargo test --workspace --lib`) there. Each release tag also
builds `proofvisor-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`
(`proofvisord.exe`, `pvctl.exe`) in `release.yml`. Since 2026-11-01 the
same `windows` job also runs the built binaries (`scripts/boot-smoke.py`):
`proofvisord.exe` boots from environment variables alone, answers
`/readyz`, proxies a streaming chat completion to a stand-in provider,
closes a signed session, `pvctl.exe` verifies the receipt and refuses a
modified copy, the receipt is on the spool, and a restart on the same
spool keeps the signing key. That is a hosted runner, not customer
hardware, and the installer, service unit and container images stay
Unix-only, so Windows remains a Tier-2 target; it is now an exercised
one rather than a compiled one.

Exercised on the hosted Windows runner (`scripts/boot-smoke.py`):

- Boot from environment variables, `/readyz`, a streamed chat
  completion through `/v1/chat/completions` to a stand-in provider,
  a signed session with its receipt sealed on the NTFS spool,
  verification with `pvctl receipt-verify` and refusal of a modified
  copy, and a restart on the same spool that keeps the signing key.

Compiled and unit-tested only on Windows (not run there as binaries):

- The MCP routes (`/mcp`, `/v1/mcp`), the WASM policy sandbox
  (wasmtime, cranelift), budgets, loop detection and the embedded
  Bridge. Receipt portability between Windows and other platforms
  follows from the canonical framing (see "Receipts are portable").
- `pvctl setup`, `pvctl doctor`, `pvctl pubkey`, console sync and the
  sidecar.
- Graceful shutdown: the daemon is built to stop on Ctrl-C (and on the
  console control events Windows maps to it) through
  `tokio::signal::ctrl_c`, running the same drain sequence as SIGTERM on
  Unix, including `shutdown_ready_drain_s`. The boot test stops the
  daemon forcefully, so this path has not been run on Windows.

Differs from Unix (the Unix behaviour is compiled out with
`#[cfg(unix)]`):

- **Secret-file permission checks are not enforced.** On Unix the
  daemon and `pvctl` refuse a signing seed, HMAC secret, backend bearer
  file, AuthZEN token file or revocation file unless it is a regular
  file with mode `0600` and not a symbolic link, and they create spool,
  receipt and Bridge files with mode `0600` and `O_NOFOLLOW`. Windows
  has no POSIX mode bits, so these checks accept any readable regular
  file and new files inherit the directory's NTFS ACL. Operators must
  restrict the configuration, secret and spool directories to the
  service account themselves (for example `icacls <dir>
  /inheritance:r /grant:r "<account>:(OI)(CI)F"`); the daemon does not
  verify the ACL. Treat a world-readable seed on Windows as a
  misconfiguration the software will not catch.
- **Directory fsync is a no-op.** The spool's parent-directory `fsync`
  (durability of a rename across a crash) has no Windows equivalent in
  the standard library and is skipped.
- **No POSIX signals.** There is no SIGTERM or SIGHUP. Service
  managers that stop a process without a console control event (for
  example the Windows Service Control Manager) are not wired; run the
  daemon in a console session, under WSL, or under a wrapper that
  delivers Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Break. `pvctl` cannot forward a termination
  signal to a child daemon on Windows.
- **Unix domain sockets** are not available, so `pvctl doctor` reports
  a Redis `unix://` endpoint as unreachable on Windows rather than
  probing it.
- **Not available natively:** `install.sh`, `deploy/systemd/`, the
  Docker/Compose and Kubernetes manifests, the Cloud Foundry buildpack
  and the hosted console (`server/`). Use WSL or a Linux host for
  these. Download the `.zip` from the GitHub release instead of running
  the installer.
- **Tests:** the integration tests that spawn the daemon, send SIGKILL
  or SIGTERM, or assert mode bits are `#[cfg(unix)]`. The Windows CI
  job runs the workspace unit tests (`--lib`) and `scripts/boot-smoke.py`
  against the built `proofvisord.exe` and `pvctl.exe`; the integration
  test suites do not run there.

## Hosted console (self-host)

`server/Dockerfile` built and passed the full API e2e suite (128
checks) on both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` on 2026-10-30. The
suite has since grown to 146 checks, which were run locally
(`docs/FEATURES.md` section 9), not in this image test. The
build stage uses `node:22` on Debian 13; the runtime stage is Google's
Distroless Node 22 image (Debian 13, non-root, no shell), with Prisma
auto-migrate and a fail-closed production env guard.

## Continuously verified

- `public-consumer.yml` (nightly): installer on 4 real runners
  (linux x64/arm64, macOS arm64/x64), 3 containers (Ubuntu 22.04,
  Debian 12, Alpine — old glibc + musl), the `PV_INSTALL_SOURCE=1`
  source build, and the full outsider quickstart.
- `release.yml`: every tag builds all Tier-1 targets; the installer
  pin bump and Pages deploy chain automatically.
