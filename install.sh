# ProofVisor — daemon installer.
#
# What this does, in order:
#   1. Detects your platform. For Linux (x86_64/aarch64, any libc —
#      the Linux binaries are static musl) and macOS (arm64/x86_64)
#      it downloads the prebuilt release binaries from GitHub, verifies
#      the SHA-256 checksum, installs `proofvisord` + `pvctl`, and
#      smoke-runs them to prove they execute on YOUR system.
#   2. Anywhere else — or with PV_INSTALL_SOURCE=1 — it cargo-installs
#      both from source, exactly as before:
#        https://github.com/ProofVisorAI/proofvisor
#      (Windows: use WSL; the static Linux binaries run there.
#       Full verified matrix incl. 32-bit ARM, riscv64, ppc64le and
#       big-endian s390x: https://proofvisor.com/PLATFORMS.md)
#   3. Prints the one guided next step (`pvctl setup`).
#
# Environment overrides:
#   PV_VERSION=0.1.0-rc.8   release to install (default: pinned below)
#   PV_INSTALL_DIR=~/bin    where prebuilt binaries land
#   PV_INSTALL_SOURCE=1     skip prebuilt path, build from source
#
# Nothing here touches your shell profile, sudo, or anything outside
# the install dir / ~/.cargo. Uninstall: remove the two binaries, or
# `cargo uninstall pv-harness pv-cli` for source installs.
